     solver command is removed in newest stack so this more likely won't work if you add deps have to mange them manualy

     stack solver --update-config 
     ./build.sh

     stack exec KafkaConsumerProducerTool
or

     stack install ->  will install it in (~/.local/bin) you need it added  in $PATH

then

    KafkaConsumerProducerTool - will run from anywhere (no need to be in project dir)
